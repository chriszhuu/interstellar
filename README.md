# Interstellar

A game where you launch a tiny rocket into space, and explores the interaction between objects under Newtonian laws of gravitation. You can steer the rocket by pressing the up key to accelerate and down key to decelerate. As the tiny rocket roams the solar system, it will experience forces from all the heavenly bodies around it: its motion and trajectory can be very interesting to see!  

There are enemy aircrafts hijacking each planet, and you can shoot them down by pressing space to fire off bullets. In that process, be careful not to run into planets or going outside the boundary of the game universe. If all enemy aircrafts are destroyed, congratulations! You have protected our solar system and we have lots of confetti for you!

Run NBody class to get started with the game :)
